# 1 - Download and Install Jupyter Notebook
 
1. **JupyterLab**

Install JupyterLab with pip:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, we recommend using the conda-forge channel.

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

```
jupyter-lab
```

2. **numpy**

For Python packages like NumPy, you can typically install them using a package manager like pip or conda. Here are the installation commands for NumPy:

Using pip:
```
pip install numpy
```

Using conda (if you are using Anaconda or Miniconda):
```
conda install numpy
```

Make sure you have Python and the respective package manager (pip or conda) installed and properly set up on your system before running these commands.

Please note that the exact command may vary depending on your operating system and Python environment. It's recommended to refer to the official documentation or consult relevant resources for detailed instructions specific to your setup.


3. **matplotlib**

To install Matplotlib, you can use the following command depending on your Python package manager:

If you're using pip:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

If you're using Anaconda:

```
conda install matplotlib
```

Both of these commands will download and install Matplotlib, along with its dependencies, into your Python environment. Make sure you have a working internet connection before executing the command.

Note: If you're using a virtual environment, activate the environment before running the installation command.

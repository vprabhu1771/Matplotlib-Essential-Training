To install Matplotlib, you can use the following command depending on your Python package manager:

If you're using pip:

pip install matplotlib


If you're using Anaconda:

conda install matplotlib


Both of these commands will download and install Matplotlib, along with its dependencies, into your Python environment. Make sure you have a working internet connection before executing the command.

Note: If you're using a virtual environment, activate the environment before running the installation command.

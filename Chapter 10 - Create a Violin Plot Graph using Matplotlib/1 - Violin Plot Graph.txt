To convert the code provided into a violin plot graph, you need to modify the code as follows:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data for the y-coordinates of the violin plot
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Create a violin plot
ax.violinplot(dataset=y)

# Add labels and a title
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Violin Plot')

# Remove x-axis ticks and labels
ax.set_xticks([])

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

In this modified code:

1. The sample data for the x-coordinates is not required for a violin plot since it visualizes the distribution of a single variable.

2. Instead of `plt.plot()`, we use `ax.violinplot(dataset=y)` to create the violin plot. The `dataset` parameter expects a list or array containing the data for the plot.

3. To remove the x-axis ticks and labels, we use `ax.set_xticks([])`.

This code will generate a simple violin plot using the given `y` data. Adjustments to the plot's appearance and style can be made by exploring the various customization options offered by Matplotlib.
